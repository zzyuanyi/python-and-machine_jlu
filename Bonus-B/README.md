The problem is to try different machine learning models (e.g. SVM, Nbayes, KNN) to learn and predict the same type of event and to obtain the relevant metrics: ACC, MCC. and also to obtain the relevant mean and variance by running them several times and plotting them using the following versions of the corresponding libraries: numpy: 1.24.3; pandas: 1.5.3; sklearn: 1.3.0; matplotlib: 3.7.2; python: 3.11.5. sklearn: 1.3.0; scipy: 1.11.3;
