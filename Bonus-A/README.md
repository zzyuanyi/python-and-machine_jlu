The problem is to try different machine learning models (e.g. SVM, Nbayes, KNN) to learn and predict the same type of event and to obtain the corresponding mean and variance by setting random numbers to be run 10 times at random: Sn, Sp, Acc, Auc, Mcc. The following versions of the corresponding libraries are used: numpy: 1.24.3; pandas: 1.5.3; sklearn: 1.3.0; matplotlib: 3.7.2; python: 3.11.5.sklearn: 1.3.0; scipy: 1.11.3
