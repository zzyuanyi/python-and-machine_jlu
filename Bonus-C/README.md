The problem is to try different machine learning models (e.g. SVM, Nbayes, KNN) to learn and predict the same type of event and to obtain the associated metric: ACC. also, by increasing the number of features as well as by making several random runs, the obtained ACC mean is plotted in the form of a heatmap. The corresponding library versions used are as follows: numpy: 1.24.3; pandas: 1.5.3; sklearn: 1.3.0; scipy: 1.11.3;seaborn:0.12.2
