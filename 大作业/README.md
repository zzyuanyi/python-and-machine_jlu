The dataset taken in this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data, the task performed is a binary classification task, where the SVM, Nbayes, KNN, RandomForest models are trained on the dataset and its corresponding labels, and then the predictions are made by the above mentioned models, the focus of this project is to mine the data and to find the better features in order to increase the prediction accuracy of the models.accuracy. 
The project focuses on mining the data and finding better features to improve the accuracy of the model prediction. The ttest test folder contains the ttest test of the data and the ranking of the data depends on the P-value and T-value respectively. In the main folder data_corr.py file is used to draw violin plots to find the distribution of the same feature values on two labels and to draw heatmaps with correlation between features as a parameter. run_sec is the subject file of the project, which uses the full dataset, compressed feature dimensions, violin plots for selecting the data, SelectKBest algorithm for extracting the features, RFE algorithm to extract features for feature selection, where only the Random Forest algorithm was used for prediction due to the characteristics of the REF algorithm. The corresponding prediction accuracy plot and heatmap of the confusion_matrix are attached in the folder.
